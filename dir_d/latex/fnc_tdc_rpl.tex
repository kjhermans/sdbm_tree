\subsection{tdc\_rpl}
\subsubsection{Declaration} Function prototype:

\begin{verbatim}
extern
int tdc_rpl
  (tdc_t* tdc, const tdt_t* value, unsigned flags);
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Description}


 ingroup btree

 Replaces the value of the element currently at the cursor.

 param tdc Non-NULL pointer to an initialized cursor structure.
 param value Potentially NULL pointer to a potentially uninitialized tdt.
 param flags Bits from TDFLG\_* and TDCFLG\_* values.

 returns Zero on success, or a TDERR\_* value on error.

 NOTE: A current limitation of this library is that the cursor will
 become invalid when doing mutations on the database while iterating
 using a cursor. This is because the cursor stores the path to the
 current node, and paths may change as a result of re-balancing of
 the tree when doing mutations. This means that tdc\_nxt(), tdc\_prv(),
 tdc\_get() and tdc\_rpl() may all return non-zero values for perhaps
 a non-obvious reason.
