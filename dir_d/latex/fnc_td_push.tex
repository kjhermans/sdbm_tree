\subsubsection{Description}


 ingroup btree

 Pushes a value into the db, creating a (time) ordered list.
 It uses the underlying principles of a btree, but is still efficient:
 the algorithm moves to the last item of the db, takes its key,
 increases the value of it bitwise (so that, under a default
 callback, it would be considered bigger), and stores the value there.
 If the db is empty, will create a key consisting of a single byte
 with value zero.
