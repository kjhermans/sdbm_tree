\subsubsection{Description}


 ingroup bree\_private

 Extends the btree's resource by a certain amount to fit new data.

 param td Non-NULL pointer to an initialized btree structure.
 param wanted Amount of space wanted.

 all that grave; the btree is otherwise intact, and API users may choose
 to recover from it gracefully.
