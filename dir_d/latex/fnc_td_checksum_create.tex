\subsubsection{Declaration} Function prototype:

\begin{verbatim}
extern
void td_checksum_create
  (void* mem, unsigned length, unsigned* checksum);
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Description}


 ingroup btree\_private

 Creates a checksum of a piece of memory.
 Does this using the FNV-1a algorithm, which is 64-bit, and
 must be reduced to sizeof(unsigned). So it is a variety of FNV.

 code

   hash = FNV\_offset\_basis
   for each byte\_of\_data to be hashed
        hash = hash XOR byte\_of\_data
        hash = hash Ã— FNV\_prime
   return hash

 endcode

 param[in] mem Non-NULL pointer to the beginning of the memory
 to be checksummed.
 param[in] length Size of the memory to be checksummed.
 param[out] checksum On return, contains the checksum of the memory piece.
